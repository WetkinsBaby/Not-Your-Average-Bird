Even after they're born, if young chicks are left out in the open, they can freeze to death in less than two minutes. The parents must keep them <a href="http://www.antarctica.gov.au/__data/assets/image/0009/44739/varieties/icynews_display.jpg">tucked close and off the ground</a> just like the egg.</p>

				<p>Some penguins have to walk for days or weeks to hit the ocean while their mate remains at the nest, without food, battling weather and those troublesome egg-eating birds. That's some hardcore dedication, and they're damn good at it. <span class="strike">CONSTANT VIGILANCE!</span> </p>

						<p>Many penguins have to wait without food and water for their mate to arrive. The most extreme situation is that of the Emperor penguin. The males guard their egg for about 2 months while the female feeds. Adding in time for travel and courtship, it can be as many as 115 days before he can feed again. Emperor males <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Penguin#Courtship_and_breeding">have been known to drop as much as 44lbs (20kg)</a>, or about 45% of their body weight, in that time.
