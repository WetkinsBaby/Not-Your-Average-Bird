# Not Your Average Bird

A quick little one-page website (about penguins) that's forcing me to do stuff and learn things. Like GitHub. Because that’s not terrifying or anything. 

The whole point of this is for me to force myself to learn, so any helpful suggestions and/or critique regarding the design, code, or my use of GitHub are appreciated. Tell me what I should be doing better! 

## Current Status: 
* ~~not looking at much beyond mobile/small screen view yet.~~
* tiptoeing beyond ~300px wide
* distantly horrified at my commits after watching a talk on how to fix them before pushing to GitHub, but haven't gotten around to figuring out exactly how to do that yet. If anyone tries to go through them, I am so, so sorry.

## I’m doing this to:
1. Practice writing concise content for the web.
2. Experiment with designing in the browser. 
3. Develop mobile-first.
4. Expand knowledge of HTML, CSS, & Javascript (and shamelessly play with new CSS3 properties).
5. Experiment with responsive design.
6. Use Git & GitHub to push myself out of my comfort zone and perfect my code and animations.
7. Slowly start using Sass.
