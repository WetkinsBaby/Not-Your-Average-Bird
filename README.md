Not Your Average Bird
=====================

A quick little one-page website (about penguins) that's forcing me to do stuff and learn things. Like GitHub. Because thatâ€™s not terrifying or anything. 

The whole point of this is for me to force myself to learn, so any helpful suggestions and/or critique regarding the design, code, or my use of GitHub are appreciated. Tell me what I should be doing better!
